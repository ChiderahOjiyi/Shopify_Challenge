-- Question 2a
--In order to see how many orders were shipped by Speedy Express we have to look at the Orders
--tables first and then the Shippers table because we will be using a Join statement
SELECT * FROM Orders;
--In order to view the Orders table and we can see that there's a foreign key leading to the Shippers table
SELECT * FROM Shippers;
/*In order to view the Shippers table
Then to get the values total orders that were shipped by Speedy Express in total we use
a join statement*/
SELECT
    Count(*) As Total
FROM Orders
JOIN Shippers
ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
WHERE ShipperName = 'Speedy Express';
--ANS = 54


--Question 2b
/*In order to see the last name of the employee with the most orders we have to look at the Orders
tables first and then the Employees table because we will be using a Join statement*/
SELECT * FROM Orders;
/*In order to view the Orders table and we can see that there's a foreign key leading to the
Employees table*/
SELECT * FROM Employees;
--In order to view the Employees table
--Then to get the last name of the employee with the most orders
SELECT
    E.LastName,
    Count(*) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders AS O
JOIN Employees AS E
ON O.EmployeeID = E.EmployeeID
Group by
E.LastName
Order by
OrderCount DESC LIMIT 1
--ANS = Peacock with an OrderCount of 40


/*Question 2c
In order to see what product was ordered the most by customers in Germany we will be using several join statements to join tables and also creating new view
*/
--First Step is to create a view from joining the Customers table with the Orders table
Create View Customer_Orders As
Select
    C.CustomerID,
    C.Country,
    O.OrderID
From Customers As C
Join Orders As O
On C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
Where C.Country = 'Germany'
--Second Step is creating a view joining the previously created view with the OrderDetails Table
Create View CO_OrDe As
Select
    *
From Customer_Orders As CO
Join OrderDetails As OrDe
On CO.OrderID = OrDe.OrderID
--And Finally to get the final solution
Select
    P.ProductName,
    Sum(CO_OrDe.Quantity) As Total_Quantity
From CO_OrDe
Join Products As P
On CO_OrDe.ProductID = P.ProductID
Group by P.ProductName
Order by Total_Quantity Desc Limit 1
--Ans = ProductName is Boston Crab Meat and the Quantity is 160
